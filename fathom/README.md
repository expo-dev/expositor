Fathom
======

Fathom is a stand-alone Syzygy tablebase probing tool. The aims of Fathom are:

* To make it easy to integrate the Syzygy tablebases into existing chess
  engines
* To make it easy to create stand-alone applications that use the Syzygy
  tablebases

Fathom is compilable under either C99 or C++ and supports a variety of
platforms, including at least Windows, Linux, and MacOS.


Programming API
---------------

Fathom provides a simple API. Following are the main function calls:

* `tb_init` initializes the tablebases
* `tb_free` releases any resources allocated by Fathom
* `tb_probe_wdl` probes the Win–Draw–Loss (WDL) table for a given position
* `tb_probe_root` probes the Distance-To-Zero (DTZ) table for the given
   position (it returns a recommended move, and also a list of unsigned
   integers, each one encoding a possible move and its DTZ and WDL values)
* `tb_probe_root_dtz` probes the Distance-To-Zero (DTZ) at the root position
   (it returns a score and a rank for each possible move)
* `tb_probe_root_wdl` probes the Win–Draw–Loss (WDL) at the root position
   (it returns a score and a rank for each possible move)

Fathom does not require the callee to provide any additional functionality
(e.g. move generation). A simple set of chess-related functions including move
generation is provided in file `tbchess.c`. However, chess engines can opt to
replace some of this functionality for better performance (see below).

Chess Engines
-------------

Chess engines can use `tb_probe_wdl` to get the WDL value during search. This
function is thread safe (unless TB_NO_THREADS is set). The various “probe_root”
functions are intended for probing only at the root node.

Chess engines can modify some features of Fathom and override some of
its internal functions by configuring `tbconfig.h`, which is included in
Fathom's code with angle brackets. This allows a client of Fathom to override
`tbconfig.h` by placing its own modified copy in its include path before the
Fathom source directory.

One option provided by `tbconfig.h` is to define macros that replace some
aspects of Fathom's functionality, such as calculating piece attacks, to avoid
duplication of functionality. If you do this, however, be careful with including
typedefs or defines from your own code into `tbconfig.h`, since these may clash
with internal definitions used by Fathom. I recommend instead interfacing to
external functions via a small module, with an interface something like this:

```
#ifndef _TB_ATTACK_INTERFACE
#define _TB_ATTACK_INTERFACE

#ifdef __cplusplus
#include <cstdint>
#else
#include <stdint.h>
#endif

extern tb_knight_attacks(unsigned square);
extern tb_king_attacks(unsigned square);
extern tb_root_attacks(unsigned square, uint64_t occ);
extern tb_bishop_attacks(unsigned square, uint64_t occ);
extern tb_queen_attacks(unsigned square, uint64_t occ);
extern tb_pawn_attacks(unsigned square, uint64_t occ);

#endif
```

You can add if wanted other function definitions such as a popcnt function based
on the chess engine's native popcnt support.

`tbconfig.h` can then reference these functions safety because the interface
depends only on types defined in standard headers. The implementation, however,
can use any types from the chess engine or other client that are necessary.
(A good optimizer with link-time optimization will inline the implementation
code even though it is not visible in the interface).

History and Credits
-------------------

The Syzygy tablebases were created by Ronald de Man. This original version of
Fathom (https://github.com/basil00/Fathom) combined probing code from Ronald de
Man, originally written for Stockfish, with chess-related functions and other
support code from Basil Falcinelli. This repository was originaly a fork of that
codebase, with additional modifications by Jon Dart.

However, this version of Fathom is no longer derived directly from the probing
code written for Stockfish, but from tbprobe.c, which is a component of the
Cfish chess engine (https://github.com/syzygy1/Cfish), a Stockfish derivative.
`tbprobe.c` was written by Ronald de Man and released for unrestricted
distribution and use.

Fathom replaces the Cfish board representation and move generation code used
in tbprobe.c with simpler code from the original Fathom source by Basil. The
code has been reorganized so that `tbchess.c` contains all move generation and
most chess-related typedefs and functions, while `tbprobe.c` contains all the
tablebase probing code. The code replacement and reorganization was done by
Jon Dart.
